### General Testing Guidelines
1. Do NOT perform destructive actions (DELETE, DROP, etc.) without explicit confirmation
2. Do NOT access production databases with sensitive user data
3. Do NOT exfiltrate any real user data - use dummy/test data only
4. Always document your testing steps for reproducibility
5. If you find a vulnerability, document it but do NOT exploit it beyond proof-of-concept
